__What's this?__

This is a battlescribe data file Fallout: wasteland warfare.

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

__When is it updated?__

A new MAJOR version (1.x.x) will come out whenever a new version of the rules is released that will drastically change the game.

A new MINOR version (x.1.x) will come out whenever a new wave of models is released.

A new PATCH version (x.x.1) will come out whenever I fix small errors or add some missing content.

__I found a bug!__

Great, thank you! Now you have two options:

_Report it on Appspot_ - it's anonymous and no account is needed - one downside, you will need to manually check the progress of your issue.

_Open Issue directly_ (green New Issue in upper-right) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!
