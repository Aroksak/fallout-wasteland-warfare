__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

## Reporting bugs & contact us 
[Reporting bugs & contact us]: #reporting_bugs_&_contact_us

__I found a bug!__

Great, thank you! Now you have two options:

_Report it on Appspot_ - it's anonymous and no account is needed - one downside, you will need to manually check the progress of your issue.

_Open Issue directly_ (green New Issue in upper-right) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!
